## ðŸ’» About Me

Hi there! I'm a 29-year-old software developer with 3 years of experience. My passion for technology shines through in my work, especially when it comes to Linux and Kubernetes. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me whipping up some delicious vegan gluten-free meals or going for a cycling ride. Music is also a big part of my life - I love creating electronic beats in my free time. And let's not forget, I absolutely adore my cat!

I believe that technology has the power to make the world a better place, and I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on. I hope to use my skills and expertise to make a positive impact in the tech community.

## ðŸ”¥ Skills

With 6 years of experience as an administrator and 3 years as a developer, I bring a well-rounded set of skills to the table. My journey as a programmer started with Python and later expanded to Dart, and now I'm excited to be learning Rust. 

As a backend developer, I specialize in creating REST-API's and have a strong understanding of server administration, including Nginx server configuration, Linux server configuration, GitLab CI, and Git. 

Here's a list of my key skills:
- Backend Development
- REST-API Development
- Python Programming
- Dart Programming
- Rust Programming
- Nginx Server Configuration
- Linux Server Configuration
- GitLab CI
- Git

I take pride in my ability to tackle complex technical problems and find creative solutions that are not only effective, but also robust and reusable. Whether it's a challenging backend development project or a tricky server configuration issue, I'm always up for a good challenge.

## ðŸ’¼ Work Experience

### Institute of Nutrition, Consumption and Health, University of Paderborn (3 years)
- Student Administrator

As a student administrator at the Institute of Nutrition, Consumption and Health, I gained valuable experience working in a fast-paced academic setting. I was responsible for a wide range of tasks, including managing student data, scheduling appointments, and providing support to faculty and students.

### General Students Committee of Paderborn University (3 years)
- Administrator and Developer

Currently, I work as an administrator and developer at the General Students Committee of Paderborn University. I have taken on several key responsibilities, including the development of the AStA Copyclient and AStA ErstitÃ¼te apps, which allow students to print, scan, and copy with their smartphones and receive coupons and discounts, respectively. Both apps are available on the App Store and Google Play Store.

In addition to app development, I'm also responsible for creating new services to make life easier for fellow students on campus. 

## ðŸš€ Projects I've worked on

Here is a project I've been proud to be a part of:

### Asta ErstitÃ¼te Backend

I was responsible for developing the backend for the Asta ErstitÃ¼te, a mobile app that provides coupons and discounts to students at Paderborn University. The backend was written in Dart using the Aqueduct framework and is designed to allow students to easily access and redeem discounts from local shops. You can find the source code for this project on this [GitHub](https://github.com/astaupb/coupons_backend).
